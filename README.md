# Stock portfolio dashboard
The Stock Portfolio Dashboard helps users efficiently buy and sell stocks based on available stock quantities. It includes robust validation checks to ensure:

1. Users cannot sell more stocks than they own.

2. Users cannot buy more stocks than the available quantity.

3. Invalid inputs are properly handled to prevent errors and maintain data integrity.

This ensures a seamless and error-free trading experience for the users.
